Homelessness in Seattle continues to grow as housing prices increase, hunger is now above the national average in Washington, transportation is limited, and not everyone has access to clean hygienic resources. By connecting and empowering families with information and resources to local community organizations, we can help them receive the basic essential necessities they need.</p>\r <br>\r <p><strong>How might Seattle Childrenâ€™s and other local nonprofits easily maintain an up-to-date website\r of local resources so that Seattle residents have a one-stop shop for local social health resources?</strong></p>\r <br>\r <p>Contact Information</p>\r <p>Yu-Won Youn: yyoun12@uw.edu</p>\r <p>Josephine Liu: jliu99@uw.edu</p>\r <p>Jonathan Lin: jonl1138@uw.edu</p>\r <p>Andy Luu: aluu5675@uw.edu</p>",
