# Seattle Children’s Website Enhancement Design Specifications

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Seattle Children’s Hospital offers many resources that can make a significant difference in the quality of life for patient families. Ranging from food banks, to gas reimbursement, to unit food delivery, these critical resources are hidden within the information architecture of their website. Our mission is to centralize available resources so families can easily find resources relevant to their situations. The addition of a family resources tab allows families to quickly and easily discover, identify, and utilize the resources available.</p>

<p>Sponsored Project: Seattle Children's</p>
<p>Project Name: Social Health Connector</p>
<br>
<p>Accessing social resources is a daunting task when people are stressed or have limited time and money. Homelessness in Seattle continues to grow as housing prices increase, hunger is now above the national average in Washington, transportation is limited, and not everyone has access to clean hygienic resources. By connecting and empowering families with information and resources to local community organizations, we can help them receive the basic essential necessities they need.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How might Seattle Children’s and other local nonprofits easily maintain an up-to-date website
of local resources so that Seattle residents have a one-stop shop for local social health resources?</strong></p>
