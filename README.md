# Capstone Project

<p>Sponsored Project: Seattle Children's</p>
<p>Project Name: Social Health Connector</p>
<br>
<p>Accessing social resources is a daunting task when people are stressed or have limited time and money. Homelessness in Seattle continues to grow as housing prices increase, hunger is now above the national average in Washington, transportation is limited, and not everyone has access to clean hygienic resources. By connecting and empowering families with information and resources to local community organizations, we can help them receive the basic essential necessities they need.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How might Seattle Childrenâ€™s and other local nonprofits easily maintain an up-to-date website
of local resources so that Seattle residents have a one-stop shop for local social health resources?</strong></p>
