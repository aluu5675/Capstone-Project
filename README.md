# Seattle Children’s Website Enhancement Design Specifications

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Seattle Children’s Hospital offers many resources that can make a significant difference in the quality of life for patient families. Ranging from food banks, to gas reimbursement, to unit food delivery, these critical resources are hidden within the information architecture of their website. Our mission is to centralize available resources so families can easily find resources relevant to their situations. The addition of a family resources tab allows families to quickly and easily discover, identify, and utilize the resources available.</p>

<p><strong>New Tab: Family Resources</strong></p>

<p>The main edit we proposed is to add a new, separate global tab to the Seattle Children’s website. The website’s current global navigation contains tabs that mainly pertain to donors and those who want to make a visit. We had originally assumed that maybe there was another interface or portal for families of Seattle Children to use. However, upon further exploration of the site, as well as through interviews with family advisors, we confirmed that families do have the natural inclination to reference the site, just as we first suspected when we started our investigation of the Seattle Children’s Hospital website’s content. We also learned that the website actually already contains resources to direct parents to the resources they need, but they’re extremely inaccessible</p>
<br>

<p>Aside from a lack of concentrated resources, the search bar is fairly unhelpful to the families who are new to getting treatment for their child and their world has most likely turned upside down. The search bar mainly returns Wikipedia-like articles, where they explain concepts, such as ‘What is organic food?’. As a family who is already emotionally burdened by a great shift of priorities in having their child treated for their illness, the last thing parents want is to be repetitively punching in different words, hoping that it’ll be a keyword in finding what they actually need. Therefore, since all the global tabs on the Seattle Children’s website represent integral parts of the website and the services provided by Seattle Children’s, we created a global tab for family resources, so it’s both more visible to parents and congregates all the Seattle Children’s provided resources in one place. The name ‘family resources’ was suggested by family advisors, as to specify what type of resources would be featured in this tab.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Category Buttons & Icons</strong></p>
<p>Another hurdle for families on the current Seattle Children’s website is the large, dense amount of text. The wall of text is already unfriendly for users, let alone families who are physically and emotionally exhausted. Therefore, the buttons at the top of the family resource homepage make it easy and intuitive for families to find what they need, since it’s divided into 6 main categories: housing, food assistance, transportation, technology, hygiene, mental health. The first three categories are meant to cover basic needs, but through interviews with family advisors, it was revealed that families also emphasized other categories aside from basic needs, such as mental health.</p>
<br>

<p>In the theme of reducing text and addressing language barriers, large icons are used to represent the categories in lieu of using text-based buttons. This also sets the user interface for the page to be more centered around the action of choosing a category, hence streamlining the user journey through visual encouragement to click on an icon.</p>


<p>Sponsored Project: Seattle Children's</p>
<p>Project Name: Social Health Connector</p>
<br>
<p>Accessing social resources is a daunting task when people are stressed or have limited time and money. Homelessness in Seattle continues to grow as housing prices increase, hunger is now above the national average in Washington, transportation is limited, and not everyone has access to clean hygienic resources. By connecting and empowering families with information and resources to local community organizations, we can help them receive the basic essential necessities they need.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>How might Seattle Children’s and other local nonprofits easily maintain an up-to-date website
of local resources so that Seattle residents have a one-stop shop for local social health resources?</strong></p>
